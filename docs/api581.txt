API 581 - Risk-Based Inspection (RBI):
API 581 provides a quantitative approach to assess risk by combining the probability of failure (POF) and the consequence of failure (COF). Core concepts:
- RBI methodology to optimize inspection resources
- POF influenced by corrosion, fatigue, and design
- COF depends on release impact, flammability, toxicity
- RBI planning and risk ranking system
